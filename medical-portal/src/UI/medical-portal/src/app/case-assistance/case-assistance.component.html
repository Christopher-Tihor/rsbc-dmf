<div class="case-assistance">
  The following are suggestions you can make to a driver to help them obtain
  their DMER Case ID for their upcoming appointment. <br />

  <b>Contact a Household Member</b> <br />
  Perhaps there is someone at home that they can contact by phone, text or email
  to help them get their DMER Case ID. <br />

  <b>Find a ICBC Office</b> <br />
  If time permits, the driver could visit the nearest ICBC Office to get a copy
  of their letter and bring it back to proceed with their appointment. <br />

  <b>Call RoadSafetyBC</b> <br />
  Please note that wait times and call back times can vary. The driver can call
  the general RoadSafetyBC (RSBC) phone number at ###-###-#### for assistance.
  As the driver will need to validate themselves on the phone with RSBC, a
  medical professional is unable to do this on the driver's behalf.
